# Rate Limiter Design

What is a rate limiter?

Why is a rate limiter necessary?

How can a rate limiter help prevent DDoS attacks?

Should a rate limiter be implemented on the client side or the server side? What are the pros and cons of each approach?

How can we notify users who are being throttled?

In this repository (and the accompanying blog), we will discuss standard algorithms and design considerations for implementing rate limiting based on system requirements.
